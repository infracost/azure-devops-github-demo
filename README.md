# Infracost Azure DevOps with GitHub Demo

See [this pull request](https://github.com/infracost/azure-devops-github-demo/pull/2) for the demo.

The [Infracost Azure DevOps integration](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-azure-devops) runs [Infracost](https://infracost.io) against pull requests. It automatically adds a pull request comment showing the cost estimate difference for the planned state if a configurable percentage threshold is crossed.

See the [Infracost integrations](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/cicd) page for other integrations.
